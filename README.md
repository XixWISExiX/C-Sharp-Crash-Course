# C-Sharp-Crash-Course

A personal repo for learning C# + .NET through small exercises and one larger end-to-end project.

## Main project: ContactManager

**Location:** `/ContactManager`

A basic CRUD contacts service built with:
- ASP.NET Core REST API (JWT auth)
- gRPC service for internal communication (proto/codegen)
- EF Core + SQLite + migrations
- Unit + integration tests
- A few practical design patterns (Strategy / Decorator / etc.)

➡️ See `/ContactManager/README.md` for full setup, commands, and curl examples.

## Other folders (C# fundamentals)

The other directories are small practice modules for core C# concepts (syntax + OOP), for example:
- `arrays/`, `lists/`, `strings/`
- `loops_and_conditionals/`, `funcs/`
- `classes_basics/`, `objects/`, `polymorphism/`
- `c-sharp-hello-world/`, `mult_table_challenge/`

Each folder is meant to be a focused sandbox rather than a “finished” project.
